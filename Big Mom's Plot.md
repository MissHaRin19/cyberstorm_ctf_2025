# Big Mom's Plot (100 pts)

## Challenge Details
- **Category:** Reverse Engineering
- **Points:** 100
- **Description:**  
  Big Mom has been keeping their new war strategies under wraps. Not even intelligence services like Cipher Pol have any clue whatâ€™s going on. Can you figure out what they are hiding in case the Straw Hat crew comes across their armies again?

- **Connection Details:**  
  ```bash
  nc cyberstorm.redfoxsec.com 4444
  ```

## Approach

### Step 1: Connecting to the Server
We used Netcat to interact with the challenge:
```bash
nc cyberstorm.redfoxsec.com 4444
```

### Step 2: Analyzing the Assembly Code
We received an ELF binary in assembly format (`warmup.asm`). The key observations:
1. **User input is read into a buffer** using the `sys_read` syscall.
2. **A loop checks each character** in the input.
3. **If any character is `~` (ASCII 126 or `0x7E`), it prints the flag.**
4. **Otherwise, the program exits.**

### Step 3: Extracting the Flag
Since the program looks for `~`, we simply entered:
```
~
```
After inputting `~`, the server responded with:
```
REDFOX{SO_W3_Wi1L_jU5T_bR1B3_Th3_Mar!n3s_WHIL3_C0mm1t1nG_W4R_Cr1m3s !!} 

```

## Tools Used
- `nc` (Netcat) for remote interaction
- `vim`/`nano` for viewing `warmup.asm`
- Assembly analysis to understand program logic
